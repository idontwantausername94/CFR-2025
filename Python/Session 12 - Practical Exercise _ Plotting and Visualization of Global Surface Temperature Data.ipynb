    "# Practical: Plotting and Visualization of Global Surface Temperature Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this practical, we will use the monthly average of the Earth’s surface temperature data from Jan 1850 to Dec 2023. We will explore various plotting techniques using Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze the data and extract meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Plot the entire temperature record with meaningful labels and correct units.\n",
    "- Visualize the seasonal cycle by plotting the last 5 years of the record.\n",
    "- Create a bar chart showing average temperatures from three different 20-year periods.\n",
    "- Calculate and plot the average temperature for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Knowledge of Python: functions, variables, lists, conditionals, loops, arrays.\n",
    "- Basic understanding of Pandas and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time: 1.5 hours**\n",

    "## Background:\n",
    "This dataset is the monthly average of the Earth’s surface (land and ocean/sea ice) temperature from Jan 1850 to Dec 2023 produced by Berkeley Earth. This record charts Earth’s unprecedented warming over the past century and is used extensively in international governmental reports to shape climate policies and ground truth climate model output.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you simply plot the time series, however, it will be challenging to discern the steady warming signal by eye. What you’ll notice is a record with a lot of wiggles, or what might be characterized as ‘noise’ when the signal of interest is Earth’s warming trend. Those persistent ups and downs in the signal are due to the asymmetry in the distribution of land between Earth’s two hemispheres, with the Northern hemisphere having more land cover than the Southern hemisphere. Given the same incoming solar radiation, the surface temperature of land will warm more than if that area is ocean. This asymmetry, in combination with the annual changes in incoming solar radiation due to the tilt of Earth’s axis (seasons!), means that the monthly average temperature of the Earth also changes over the year. This is called a seasonal cycle. The seasonal cycle of the global average surface temperature of the Earth follows the Northern Hemisphere, warmest in July and coldest in January. This seasonal cycle is a natural cycle for Earth’s climate due to Earth’s rotation around the sun, the tilt of Earth’s axis, and the distribution of land over the surface of the Earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "In climate science, there are lots of different natural cycles that imprint on observed quantities like the average global surface temperature or the average amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Scientists often quantify these natural cycles by calculating what are called climatologies. A climatology is simply an average of a natural cycle of a quantity taken over a period of time that is understood to be representative of that natural cycle. Sometimes that period is described as the baseline. To calculate the seasonal climatology for Earth’s monthly global average surface temperature, you would average all the January’s in the record to find the climatological January, and then average all the February’s in the record, and so on. The end result is a typical (average) year in global average surface temperature on Earth. The period of time to include in this calculation will depend on your scientific interests and questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these natural cycles are interesting, researchers are most interested in the way the climate system deviates from this natural cycle. The deviations of a quantity from its average cycle (climatology) is called an anomaly. Anomalies are very interesting. They tell us how a particular data point compares to other data points which should be very similar to it because of the presence of natural cycles. It’s the way we know if this June is hot compared to all the other previous June’s in our records. This is how we quantify exactly how much our Earth has warmed in the past century.\n",
